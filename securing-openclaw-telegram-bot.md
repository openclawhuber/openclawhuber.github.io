*Your AI agent is powerful. Make sure it's not wide open to strangers.*

---

If you've set up OpenClaw with a Telegram bot, congratulations — you've got an AI assistant you can reach from anywhere. But here's the thing: **a misconfigured bot is an open door**. Anyone who finds your bot's username can DM it, trigger actions, and potentially access your files, calendar, and connected services.

I learned this the hard way setting up my own OpenClaw instance. Here's everything I found, and how to lock it down in under 5 minutes.

## The #1 Mistake: Open DM Policy

OpenClaw's Telegram config has a setting called `dmPolicy`. If it's set to `"open"`, **literally anyone on Telegram** can message your bot and get a response — as your agent, with your tools and API keys.

```json
// ❌ DANGEROUS — don't do this
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "dmPolicy": "open",
      "allowFrom": ["*"]
    }
  }
}
```

### The Fix

Use `"allowlist"` or `"pairing"` mode, and specify exactly who can talk to your bot:

```json
// ✅ SAFE — only your Telegram user ID
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "dmPolicy": "allowlist",
      "allowFrom": ["123456789"]
    }
  }
}
```

**How to find your Telegram user ID:**
1. DM your bot
2. Run `openclaw logs --follow`
3. Look for `from.id` in the log output

Or message `@userinfobot` on Telegram.

## Check #2: Gateway Bind Address

If your gateway is bound to `0.0.0.0` or `"lan"`, it's accessible to anyone on your network:

```json
// ✅ Loopback only — safe
{
  "gateway": {
    "bind": "loopback"
  }
}
```

If you need remote access, use **Tailscale** (`"bind": "tailnet"`) — never expose the gateway to the open internet without auth.

## Check #3: Gateway Authentication

Make sure `gateway.auth.mode` is set to `"token"`:

```json
{
  "gateway": {
    "auth": {
      "mode": "token",
      "token": "your-random-secret-here"
    }
  }
}
```

Without this, anyone who can reach your gateway port can control your agent.

## Check #4: Group Policy

If your bot is in Telegram groups, `groupPolicy` controls who can interact:

- `"allowlist"` (default) — only approved users
- `"open"` — any group member (use with caution in public groups)

## Check #5: Model Fallbacks

Not a security issue per se, but if your primary model goes down and you have no fallback, your bot goes silent. Set one:

```bash
openclaw models fallbacks add openai-codex/gpt-5.3-codex
```

## Automate It: Free Audit Script

I built a free, open-source audit script that checks all of this automatically:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openclawhuber/openclaw-audit/main/openclaw-audit.sh | bash
```

It checks 7 security dimensions and gives you a color-coded report in seconds. No data leaves your machine.
